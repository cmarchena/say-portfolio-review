**Requirements and Delivery** | Completed less than 70% of the requirements. Delivered on time but not in correct format. | Completed between 70-80% of the requirements. Delivered on time, and in correct format. | Completed between 80-90% of the requirements. Delivered on time, and in correct format. | Completed between 90-100% of the requirements. Delivered on time, and in correct format.
**Coding Standards** | No name, date, or assignment title included. Poor use of white space (indentation, blank lines). Disorganized and messy. Poor use of variables (many global variables, ambiguous naming). | Includes name, date, and assignment title. White space makes program fairly easy to read. Organized work. Good use of variables (few global variables, unambiguous naming). | Includes name, date, and assignment title. Good use of white space. Organized work. Good use of variables (no global variables, unambiguous naming). | Includes name, date, and assignment title. Excellent use of white space. Creatively organized work. Excellent use of variables (no global variables, unambiguous naming).
**Documentation** | Very limited or no documentation included. Documentation does not help the reader understand the code. | Basic documentation has been completed including descriptions of all class variables. Purpose is noted for each function. | Clearly documented including descriptions of all class variables. Specific purpose is noted for each function and control structure. | Clearly and effectively documented including descriptions of all class variables. Specific purpose noted for each function, control structure, input requirements, and output results.
**Runtime** | Does not execute due to errors. User prompts are misleading or non-existent. No testing has been completed, or no input validation. | Executes without errors. User prompts contain little information, poor design. Some testing or input validation has been completed. | Executes without errors. User prompts are understandable, minimum use of symbols or spacing in output. Most testing or input validation completed. | Executes without errors. Excellent user prompts, good use of symbols, spacing in output. Thorough and organized testing or input validation has been completed.
**Efficiency** | A difficult to understand and inefficient solution. Code is huge and appears to be patched together. | A logical solution that is easy to follow but it is not the most efficient. | The code is fairly efficient without sacrificing readability and understanding. | Solution is efficient, easy to understand, and maintain².
